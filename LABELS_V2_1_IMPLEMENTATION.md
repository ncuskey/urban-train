# Labels v2.1 Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses label visibility issues and improves the label generation system to be more robust and show more labels. **Version 2.1** adds advanced collision avoidance and size-based zoom filtering.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Label Visibility Issues

**Problem**: Labels were rendering once then disappearing due to:
- Layer z-order issues (labels under the map)
- Over-eager visibility filters hiding them
- Conflicting transforms on #labels children

**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Layer hierarchy**: Ensured labels are always on top with `.raise()` calls
- ✅ **Non-destructive visibility**: Use style-based show/hide instead of DOM manipulation
- ✅ **Proper zoom transforms**: Only transform #world container, not #labels
- ✅ **CSS styling**: Added proper styles for current label structure

### 2. Labels v2.1 Enhancements

**Problem**: Label system was too restrictive, showing few labels and dropping generics globally

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Removed global generic drop**: Each component gets a label (named if available, otherwise generic)
- ✅ **Robust ocean/lake classification**: Use explicit map bounds instead of relying on p.bounds
- ✅ **No minimum size thresholds**: All lakes and islands get names, regardless of size
- ✅ **Increased max counts**: Allow more lakes (500) and islands (800)

### 3. Advanced Collision Avoidance

**Problem**: Labels were overlapping, making them unreadable

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Quadtree-based collision detection**: Efficient spatial queries for overlap detection
- ✅ **Spiral placement algorithm**: Tries up to 20 positions around centroid when collision detected
- ✅ **Priority-based placement**: Oceans > lakes > islands to ensure important features get placed first
- ✅ **Fallback placement**: Places at centroid with overlap if no collision-free position found

### 4. Size-Based Zoom Filtering

**Problem**: All labels visible at all zoom levels created visual clutter

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Size-based visibility rules**: Features appear based on area and zoom level
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Small features appear as zoom increases
- ✅ **Maximum limits**: Prevents overcrowding at high zoom levels
- ✅ **Smooth transitions**: Labels appear/disappear based on zoom level

- Added proper CSS for current label structure (`text.stroke` and `text.fill`)

### New Files

#### `debug-labels.js`
- Diagnostic script for browser console debugging
- Checks DOM structure, transforms, and visibility

#### `test-labels-v2.1.html`
- Comprehensive test for Labels v2.1 functionality
- Validates multiple labels, generics preservation, DOM counts

#### `test-collision-zoom.html`
- **NEW**: Interactive test for collision avoidance and zoom filtering
- Tests collision detection with overlap analysis
- Tests size-based zoom filtering at multiple zoom levels
- Provides real-time zoom controls and statistics

## Configuration

### New Defaults
```javascript
{
  minOceanArea: 6000,    // was 9000
  minLakeArea: 0,        // was 250 - NO MINIMUM SIZE
  minIslandArea: 0,      // was 400 - NO MINIMUM SIZE
  maxOceans: 4,          // unchanged
  maxLakes: 500,         // was 10
  maxIslands: 800        // was 12
}
```

### Size-Based Zoom Filtering Rules
```javascript
// Oceans: Always visible
// Lakes: 
//   - Tiny (50+ area) visible at zoom 2x+
//   - Small (200+ area) visible at zoom 1x+
//   - Medium (800+ area) visible at zoom 0.5x+
//   - All lakes visible at zoom 4x+
// Islands:
//   - Tiny (30+ area) visible at zoom 1.5x+
//   - Small (150+ area) visible at zoom 0.8x+
//   - Medium (600+ area) visible at zoom 0.4x+
//   - All islands visible at zoom 3x+
```

### Required Parameters
- `mapWidth`: Required for boundary detection
- `mapHeight`: Required for boundary detection

## Debug Output

The system now provides comprehensive debug logging:

```
[labels] comps: { oceans: X, lakes: Y, islands: Z, waterComps: W, landComps: L }
[labels] after build: { built: N, placed: N }
[labels] DEBUG: Collision avoidance placed N out of N labels
[labels] zoom filter: k=1.00, total=N, visible=N
[labels] visible by kind: { ocean: X, lake: Y, island: Z, other: W }
[labels] updateLabelVisibility: total=N visible=N k=1.00
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Open `index.html` - should see multiple labels with no overlaps
2. Open browser console - should see debug output
3. Run `debugLabels()` in console for detailed diagnostics
4. Test zoom in/out - labels should appear/disappear based on size and zoom
5. **NEW**: Open `test-collision-zoom.html` for interactive testing

### Automated Testing
1. Open `test-labels-v2.1.html` - validates all functionality
2. Open `test-label-zoom.html` - tests zoom behavior
3. **NEW**: Open `test-collision-zoom.html` - tests collision avoidance and size-based filtering

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Multiple labels**: X+Y+Z > 1 in component counts  
✅ **Generic preservation**: Each component gets a label  
✅ **No minimum size**: All lakes and islands get names  
✅ **Collision avoidance**: Minimal or no overlapping labels  
✅ **Size-based filtering**: Small features appear at appropriate zoom levels  
✅ **Smooth zoom transitions**: Labels appear/disappear smoothly  
✅ **Performance**: Efficient collision detection and zoom filtering  

## Performance Considerations

- **Quadtree collision detection**: O(log n) spatial queries for efficient overlap checking
- **Spiral placement**: Limited to 20 attempts per label to prevent infinite loops
- **Size-based filtering**: Pre-computed thresholds for fast visibility decisions
- **Maximum limits**: Prevents exponential growth of visible labels at high zoom

## Future Enhancements

- **Label clustering**: Group nearby small labels at low zoom
- **Dynamic font sizing**: Adjust label size based on zoom level
- **Label animation**: Smooth fade in/out transitions
- **User preferences**: Configurable size thresholds and zoom rules
